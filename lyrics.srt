1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
流れてく　時の中ででも
Ever on and on I continue circling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
気だるさが　ほらグルグル廻って
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
私から　離れる心も
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
見えないわ　そう知らない？
And suddenly I see that I can't break free — I'm

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
自分から　動くこともなく
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
時の隙間に　流され続けて
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
知らないわ　周りのことなど
To tell me who I am, who I was — Uncertainty

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
私は私　それだけ
Enveloping my mind till I can't break free — And

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
夢見てる？　なにも見てない？
Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
語るも無駄な　自分の言葉？
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
悲しむなんて　疲れるだけよ
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
何も感じず　過ごせばいいの
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
戸惑う言葉　与えられても
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to go

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
自分の心　ただ上の空
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
もし私から　動くのならば
If I make another move there'll be no more turning back

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
すべて変えるのなら　黒にする
Because everything will change and it all will fade to black

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
こんな自分に　未来はあるの？
Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
こんな世界に　私はいるの？
Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
今切ないの？　今悲しいの？
Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay, or should I go?

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
自分の事も　わからないまま
I've forgotten how to tell. Did I ever even know?

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
歩むことさえ　疲れるだけよ
Can I take another step? I've done everything I can

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
人のことなど　知りもしないわ
All the people that I see I will never understand

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
こんな私も　変われるのなら
If I find a way to change, if I step into the light

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
もし変われるのなら　白になる？
Then I'll never be the same and it all would fade to white

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
流れてく　時の中ででも
Ever on and on I continue circling

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
気だるさがほら　グルグル廻って
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
私から　離れる心も
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
見えないわそう　知らない？
And suddenly I see that I can't break free — I'm

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
自分から　動くこともなく
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
時の隙間に　流され続けて
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
知らないわ　周りのことなど
To tell me who I am, who I was — Uncertainty

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
私は私　それだけ
Enveloping my mind till I can't break free — And

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
夢見てる？　なにも見てない？
Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
語るも無駄な　自分の言葉？
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
悲しむなんて　疲れるだけよ
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
何も感じず　過ごせばいいの
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
戸惑う言葉　与えられても
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to go

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
自分の心　ただ上の空
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
もし私から　動くのならば
If I make another move there'll be no more turning back

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
すべて変えるのなら　黒にする
Because everything will change and it all will fade to black

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
動くのならば　動くのならば
If I make another move, if I take another step

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
すべて壊すわ　すべて壊すわ
Then it all would fall apart. There'd be nothing of me left

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
悲しむならば　悲しむならば
If I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
私の心　白く変われる？
Will there ever be a way? Will my heart return to white?

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
貴方の事も　私のことも
Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
全ての事も　まだ知らないの
I've forgotten how too see; I've forgotten if I can

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
重い目蓋を　開けたのならば
If I opened up my eyes there'd be no more going back

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
すべて壊すのなら　黒になれ！！！
'Cause I'd throw it all away and it all would fade to black!!!
